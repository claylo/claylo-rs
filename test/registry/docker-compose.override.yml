# Override to use pre-built images from GHCR
#
# This file is automatically loaded by docker compose when present.
# It speeds up startup by pulling pre-built images instead of building locally.
#
# To build locally instead:
#   just registry-build
#
# To re-enable pre-built images:
#   just registry-use-prebuilt
