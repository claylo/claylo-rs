# commit message rules

I will give credit to Claude Code, Codex, or any other coding agent on my terms.

NEVER add any Claude Code attribution to commit messages.

> [!CAUTION]
> Example of what NOT to do:

```markdown
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Git commit messages should explain why, not what. The diff explains what.
